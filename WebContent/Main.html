				Max Drabkin is a very committed, creative and professional person and you should vote for him to be the VP Communications of the AUS. In the time I've known Max he has surprised me over and over again with his ability to balance school and his extracurricular activities. Working for the Bull and Bear doing video editing, he has done an amazing job capturing the spirit of McGill. Max is a very friendly and approachable person who will be a great team member on the AUS. I have no doubt in my mind that he will do an amazing job.

My entire group felt included and comfortable, his leadership and charisma was a perfect way to be introduced to the dynamic McGill community. I have no doubt that max will be a successful VP communications  and show the same dedication to this position as he did my frosh group.

I am struck by his ability and willingness to take on leadership roles and build strong relationships with the people he works with. He has a great affinity for motivating and organizing a group of people to achieve a wide variety of goals and I believe his skill set and experiences make him an ideal candidate for the AUS VP Communications position.

				When we interviewed Max, we just knew we had to have him on our team. He was enthusiastic, showed immense work ethic and commitment, and brought value-added skills to the table. Throughout the year, he has flawlessly followed through on all his responsibilities while taking on new initiatives. I have no doubt that as VP Communications of the AUS, Max will be fully able to perform his tasks, add value to it, keep the AUS President up to date, and cater to the needs of all members of the Arts Undergraduate Society.

				<div id="aboutDrop" class="drop">
					Hello everyone!!! My name is Max Drabkin and I’m running to be the AUS VP Communications for the upcoming year! I’m a 3rd year Economics major with a Minor in Management. I originally transferred from the Science Faculty but have since found my calling in Arts. As your VP Communications, I will dedicate my time and effort to making this upcoming year one of the most aspirational and creative for the AUS. Working with your other execs, we will aim to provide you as Arts students, a sense of identity within your faculty, something that Arts has been having difficulty with for some time.

				<div class="dropper"><strong>PLATFORM:</strong><br></div>
				<div class="encapsulate">
					<div class="dropper"><strong><span id="platformOne">1) Expanded Photography and Cinematography Services</span></strong></div>
					<div class="drop" id="dropTwo">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First and foremost, I wish to provide Arts students with the ability to rent out cameras from the AUS just like they would a book, to be able to film and shoot video on their own time. With AUS funding, I wish to purchase 5 medium to top quality DSLR’s (Personally I’m a Canon guy) that students can rent with their ID, and a simple credit deposit. I will personally oversee the filming of specific Arts events, along with my team of aspiring cinematographers and together we will make videos highlighting the events that Arts is holding, which will both boost our social and online presence. </div>

					<br><div class="dropper"><strong>2) Simplified yet Engaging Listserv</strong></div>
					<div class="drop" id="dropThree">
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most problematic realities faced by the AUS VP Communications in the past is getting individuals to read the weekly Listservs. In the most recent year, the Listserv underwent a few changes, taking a step in the right direction when it was split into “Happenings, Announcements, and Opportunities.” I will take the next step and make the listserv more reader-friendly by:<br>
						<div id="sectionOne">	
							<br>i) Simplicity – Instead of having a long email that is arduous for anyone to read through, I will condense it into a Table of Contents, with each of the titles being a link that when clicked, will direct the individual to the AUS website. This will both direct the person away from the idea of the listserv being junk email and generate more traffic to our website. Our website is one of the most well designed information centers I have ever seen, let's use this to our advantage. (To clarify I would also keep the Happenings/Announcements/Opportunities the same)<br>
							<br>ii) Engaging – I wish to bring more interest and creativity to the Listserv, treating it more like a place where people can go to find distinguishing stories. For example: I will do a “Weekly Spotlight” of an individual in the Arts faculty who is expressing their creativity in a certain way and highlight them on the Listserv for all the Arts students to see, giving them reach and exposure. Applications will start anew at the beginning of each week. I would also feature 1 new inspirational video each week that people can check out and submit themselves (Either if they created it on their own or found it online) This is one of my favorites: (Youtube is down for me right now so I will paste it in when I get the chance)<br>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="encapsulate">
					<br><div class="dropper"><strong>3) Dynamic Duo with VP Events (Social)</strong></div>
					<div class="drop">
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The VP Events Position, now renamed VP Social, is a critical one to the engagement within the faculty. I plan to work directly with this position to maximize both the events and their exposure, because communicating these events to the faculty are crucial and this partnership cohesiveness is essential to a successful year. Other than this I plan to do the following:<br>
						<div id="sectionTwo">
							<br>i) Continue the film series and prof talk that was previously started last year<br>
							(I will review all the current initiatives being taken on and evaluate their success so far and their possibility to grow in the future)<br>
							<br>ii) Work with other faculties that I have a lot of experience with to bring inter-	faculty competitions, whether it be trivia or scavenger hunts, but also collaboration for larger events to pool our resources together<br>
							<br>iii) Get notable speakers to come to McGill to give talks, the Management Faculty is incredibly successful in this regard and there’s no reason we can’t do this too. <br>
